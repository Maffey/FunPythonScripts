# FunPythonScripts
Variety of mostly completely useless and reduntant scripts made for fun in Python. Most of them were made long ago, circa 2013.

## Table of Contents
1. beepBoop.py - Simple app with purpose to annoy the user with its sounds.
2. ciscoSetupHelper.py - Never finished script that intented to help configure a Cisco router.
3. lotteryWinningsCalc.py - Calculator made for fun to figure out, hypothetically, how much money can spend monthly to live until retirement with the lottery money evenly distributed across months.
4. textGameRPG.py - RPG text-based game that was abandoned early. Only first stage exists and it's very crude. Also, terrible coding inside!
5. wisePick.py - Dota 2 app that gives verbose advice about picking heroes in Dota. It was useless then and even more useless now, since meta in Dota 2 changes rapidly. One of the oldest of my Python scripts.
