    cs = "Any kind of carry can work. But because mostly Radiant bot means jungle and the juke bots near towers," \
         " you can go for more risky heroes like Anti-Mage, Spectre or Medusa." \
         " Keep in mind that without proper support laning stage may go horribly."
    ch = "Pick carry that is good early, such as Slark or Mirana and go solo or ask for strong support" \
         " who can secure kills easily."
    ss = "Get courier, upgrade it ASAP and try to get boots. You should little babysit your hard carry" \
         " or any other hero you have on lane but then proceed to create space on map. If you have support" \
         " that can deal with jungle creeps (Sand King, Crystal Maiden)" \
         " make something out of it and farm for yourself basic items."
    sh = "You should buy wards and run fast to get vision over Dire jungle. You need strong core hero on lane." \

    os = "It's kind of weird place for offlaner but you might want it in few situations but you have to understand" \
         " why you need it. First of all: You can benefit from jungle (Batrider, Dark Seer etc.); You can also" \
         " play close to tower thanks to ability to pull, which means you can pick hero that normally" \
         " would be weak offlaner."
    oh = "Try to get few last hits, but play safe. Get the every exp you can and when you will be able to fight," \
         " try to do so, to make space on the map."
    m = "Pick obviously hero that really benefit from safe solo lane like that." \
        " Most carries with good ultimates will work. Most offlanes will also work." \
        " It's up to what your team needs."
    j = "Going jungle means that no matter which role you chose, you won't really play that role." \
        " If you picked offlane or mid - well, it's weird. Jungler is either carry or support." \
        " Kind of. It's hard to explain so we will focus on two things that jungle provides: safe farm" \
        " and more heroes on map with solo exp. Many heroes will work - Chen, Enigma, Ursa." \
        " Just try to gank lane if your hero is able to do so."
